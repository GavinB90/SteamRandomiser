# SteamRandomiser
C# and Xamarin

Small project to build an app in Xamarin to randomly select a game from a Steam games library.

Three options to find a game:

1. Any random game from the steam library
2. Any random game that has not been played yet (played time of 0)
3. Any random game that has already been played

To run:
You will need to put the API key and Steam id into the GetSteamGames.cs file.
